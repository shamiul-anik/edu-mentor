<div><strong>Project Description</strong></div>
1. <strong>Introduction:</strong>
We propose to develop a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack web application aimed at connecting students or parents seeking home tutors with qualified and reliable tutors in their local area. The platform will serve as a centralized hub for the hiring process, providing an efficient and user-friendly solution for both students and tutors.

2. <strong>Project Scope:</strong>
The MERN-based web application will enable users to register as either a student or a tutor. Once registered, students can browse a directory of qualified tutors, view their profiles, ratings, and reviews, and directly contact them for tutoring services. Tutors, on the other hand, can create detailed profiles showcasing their expertise, experience, and availability.

3. <strong>Key Features:</strong>
- <strong>Home Page:</strong> Interactive home page with sections like Photo Gallery, Popular Tutors, Tuition Types, Statistics, Statistics, Our Happy Students, Success Story and Newsletter.
<strong>Details:
<strong>Photo Gallery:</strong> Gallery of the happy students.
<strong>Popular Tutors:</strong> Sort data in Descending Order based on tutors ratings. Additional sorting based on total view counts in Descending Order. Try to combine both ideas to show better results.
Here, user roles=”tutors”. Show name, email, location, subjects and View Details button.
Clicking on the button will take the logged in users to the tutor’s details page and update the view count by 1 (total_view += 1).
